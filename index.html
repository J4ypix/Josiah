                                <h3>History of computing</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The history of computing is fascinating to me because all the technologies originated many years ago. Without those technology pioneers, there would be no computers,
                                    cellphones, or any modern gadgets today. It makes me think that people from ancient times were incredibly intelligent because they were able to discover technologies 
                                    without any help or references. Back then, everything was limited, and there were fewer discoveries compared to today, yet they were able to achieve pioneering advancements.

                                <h3>How computers work</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In this second phase of my learning, I am exploring how computers work. It amazes me how intricately computers were designed; it almost seems implausible. Just imagine,
                                    computers process an enormous number of bits per second. Everything done previously seems shorter and simpler in comparison.

                                    The fascinating aspect of computers lies in their design â€“ the CPU, RAM, HDD, inputs, and outputs. Each component has its logical functions that
                                    Makes me think the person who invented the computer is incredibly smart

                                    Finally, the most interesting and challenging parts of my learning journey. I had a lot of fun 
                                    converting my name into bits and all of the other conversion; it was quite enjoyable and I gained new and alot of knowledge from it. However, the most challenging aspect was creating webpages.

                                    Honestly, I don't have any experience in webpage creation, and it wasn't covered in our class. Therefore, creating
                                    a webpage feels like a huge wall that's very tough for me to overcome.

                                Music, in general, gives me peace, but nothing beats the feeling of producing harmonies and sound by using your own hands through an instrument.
                                The guitar is one of my comforts during my heart attack days.
                                That's why I am proud to showcase my guitar skills to everyone.
                                Below is a video of me playing the guitar.

                                Back then, I was really chubby and had an unhealthy lifestyle. But now, I am flaunting my transformed body to everyone despite it all.
                                However, everything took a downturn when I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse in the heart.
                                Presently, I am not progressing towards my dream body anymore.

                                Last but not least, my favorite one - my dog. His name is Handsome, and he is the cutest dog I have, although
                                his name is Handsome, and the owner is not :) He has definitely become one of the aspects that helped
                                me overcome my trauma from MVP. Thus, I can say he is one of my stress-relieving pills.
